Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (19:50): I had the immense privilege of attending the awards ceremonies for the great Bate Bay surf clubs of Cook. North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club formed in 1925. Wanda Surf Life Saving Club formed in 1946, and Elouera Surf Life Saving Club formed in 1967. The surf lifesavers in my electorate keep the electorate safe. There is a sense of community in these clubs, a sense of family and a sense of service. Each season, surf lifesavers spend in excess of 650,000 hours voluntary patrolling the most accessible and inaccessible beaches in New South Wales. I'd like to take this opportunity to recognise some exceptional individuals from the electorate and from these clubs.

Firstly, at Wanda Surf Life Saving Club, there is the lovely father and daughter duo: the Junior Lifesaver of the Year, Sienna Dunham, and the open Lifesaver of the Year, Mark Dunham. The Golden Cap was awarded to Glenn Bell and the CV Forshaw Award went to Kaylene Walker. There was an award going to the outgoing patron of 26 years, Ernest 'Solly' Stephens, who still has a cold ocean swim every morningâ€”even in his 90s. There was the presentation of three new life members: Greg Pierce, James Traves and Grant Sandstrom. At the Australian championships in Queensland in 2024, they also had a number of people win Aussie championships. Ben Sutton won the Champion Lifesaver. The under-14 two-kilometre beach run was won by Kyah Gallen. The under-14 two-by-one-kilometre beach relay was won by Kyah Gallen and Layla White. The under 17 board rescue was won by Otis Jessop and Dane Sutton. The under-15 two-kilometre swim was won by Charlotte Bowmer. The under 14 and 15 Cameron relay was won by Charlotte Bowmer, Jade Seidel, Piper Phillips, and Poppy Hulbert. The open female five-person R&R was won by Emily Caterson, Amelia Dann, Isla Jokhan, Katie Spinner and Joanna Stavrou. The Curlewis six-person mixed R&R was won by Emily Caterson, Brock Douglas, Blake McCrindle, Kurt Melville, Grant Sandstrom, Stuart Smith and Gordon McKirdy.

Secondly, I also had the honour of attending the North Cronulla Surf Life Saving club's awards nights. The Junior Surf Lifesaver of the Year went to Cody Edson. The Senior Lifesaver of the Year went to Mark Anders. The Junior Club Captain went to Harry Payne. The Senior Club Captain went to Dan Lawson. There were a number of awards for 10 years of service with 100 per cent attendance at patrol. They went to David Cannings and Anthony Sobb. The Major James Perryman Award also went to Anthony Sobb. The Norm Rees Award went to Alison and Michael Bofinger. Also at North Cronulla, there were a number of Australian champions who were crowned Australian champions in Queensland. The under-15 female beach flag went to Scarlett Hoerr. The under-17 mixed five-person R&R went to Ella Murdoch, Milly Newton, Layla King, Kirra Hodge, Lily Thearle and Kristine Whitford. The under-19 mixed five-person R&R went to Ashlyn Lloyd, Milly Newton, Layla King, Kirra Hodge, Lily Thearle and Kristine Whitford. The reserve grade male surf boat short course went to Chris Sims, Corey Dietrich, Pat Hunt, Ben Robson and Michael Bofinger. The reserve grade male surf boat went to Chris Sims, Kobi Markey, Pat Hunt, Ben Robson and Michael Bofinger. The under-17 male beach sprint went to Kobe Sorensen. The under-14 mixed two-person R&R went to Sophie Heron, Anna McCrone and Karen Goman. The under-19 male surf board riding, open male long board and open male short board riding all went to Cruz McKee.

To Elouera: the Open Athlete of the Year was Charlie Morris; the Water Man of the Year was Mitch Green; the Water Woman of the Year was Mikaela Mead; the Most Outstanding Male Beach Athlete was Peter Thoroughgood; the Most Outstanding Female Beach Athlete was Sabina Rogers; the Most Outstanding Masters Competitor was Sean Green; the Most Outstanding Boat Competitor was Sam Cohen; the Tim Nesbitt Rookie of the Year was Jonah Chapman; the Most Outstanding Trainer was Mark Taylor; the Most Improved Trainer was Rob Van Der Sanden; the Junior Patrol Person of the Year was Austin Alexander; the Patrol Person of the Year was Patrick Hughes; the President's Trophy went to Kiara Summers; the Encouragement Award went to Stephen Urquhart; and, lastly, the Outstanding Contribution in Club Contribution and Service went to Kaitlyn Byrnes. I look forward to attending Cronulla's awards night in the coming weeks.
