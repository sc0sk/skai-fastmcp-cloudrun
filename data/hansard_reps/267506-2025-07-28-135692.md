Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (16:40): Nelson Mandela once said, 'Sport has the power to unite people in a way that little else does.' This was clearly on display last weekend in the Sutherland shire, where 8,000 of my constituents pounded the pavement in the Sutherland 2 Surf, from Sutherland to beautiful, sunny Wanda Beach. The race was won by Aidan Velten, a 19-year-old from here in Canberra, who edged out the defending champion, Thomas Do Canto, and Paralympian Michael Roeger in one of the closest finishes in the event's history.

In the women's field, Danette Sheehan, originally from Canada, took out first place, completing a remarkable progressionâ€”third place two years ago, second place last year and first place this year. Our local talent was on display, with Jared Hurly and Sienna Bass from the Cronulla Track Club winning the under-16 category.

I also want to thank the Sutherland 2 Surf organising committee from Wanda Surf Life Saving Club, including convener Kate Spinner, club president Fiona Sutton and committee members Anne Caterson OAM, Sue Brannock, Ric Smith, Stuart Smith and Gary McNamara. Their tireless work makes this event possible.

To everyone who ran, volunteered, donated and cheered, congratulations and thank you for what you do for our beautiful community in Cook.
