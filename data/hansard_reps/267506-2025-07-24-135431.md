I also want to celebrate the Southern Sydney Business Awards in my local community. Small business is the backbone of our country and our economy. Small and medium-sized businesses make up nearly 70 per cent of employment and almost 98 per cent of businesses, and while small business hires, large business fires. Small and medium-sized businesses that grew made up 100 per cent of net job growth in the Australian economy. Not only are they the backbone of the Australian economy; they're the backbone of my local community in Cook. This year's winners in Cook were, for excellence in large business, Geoff Bannister from Betty's Burgers, Miranda, and, for the most outstanding community organisation, Karen Johnston from BFF 4 Change.

I'd also like to acknowledge a tragic accident. My condolences and prayers go out to the boys and families involved in the tragic jet ski accident on Tuesday evening on the Georges River in Sylvania. Tragically, this accident claimed the life of 15-year-old Mitchell Irvine and left his friend 14-year-old Noah Watkins seriously injured. Mitchell's loss and Noah's injuries have devastated my local community and serve as a heartbreaking reminder of how fragile life is. To Mitchell's family: we mourn with you—me and the rest of our beautiful community in Cook. To Noah and your family: our thoughts and prayers are with you for a speedy recovery. I would also like to pay special tribute to police officer Jesse Hockey and paramedic Scott McNamara, who showed extraordinary courage diving into the cold, deep, dark, murky water to help Noah and save his life. Their bravery reflects the best of our emergency services and reflects the community spirit and bravery that all of our community in the seat of Cook exhibits.
