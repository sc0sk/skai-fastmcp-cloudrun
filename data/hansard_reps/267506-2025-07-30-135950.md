Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (19:49): On Sunday 27 July, something remarkable took place in my electorate of Cook—something cold but something full of heart. Down at Gunnamatta Bay in Cronulla, just after sunrise, dozens of locals gathered for the Special Olympics Polar Plunge. It's not every day you see members of the police, emergency services, community volunteers and sports teams, like the Cronulla water polo team, sprinting into icy water in the middle of winter, but that's exactly what happened—and they did it for a reason that deeply matters.

The polar plunge is part of the Special Olympics Australia and the Law Enforcement Torch Run, raising both awareness and funds for Australians with intellectual disabilities and autism. It's more than sport. It's about belonging. It's about inclusion, not just in words but in actions. There was a torch run through Gunnamatta reserve and a ceremonial torch lighting and then the plunge itself. Everyone from young athletes to senior officers took part. The money raised during the events will fund uniforms, equipment, transport and competition opportunities for athletes who too often face barriers to participation. It means more kids on fields, more smiles on podiums and more stories of achievement in every postcode of Cook. To the organisers, volunteers and especially the athletes, thank you for what you've done—not just for raising money but for reminding us all what inclusion and community looks like.

I want to congratulate the Wanda Surf Life Saving Club, which has served the Sutherland Shire with distinction for 75 years. It's more than a surf club; it's a community institution built on service, self-sacrifice and teamwork. Each year, Wanda recognises members who go above and beyond to keep our Bate Bay and our club culture strong. I want to recognise the 2024-25 major award winners, who reflect the best of that tradition.

Congratulations to: Grant Sandstrom, Most Consistent Member; Mark McGuinness, Open Lifesaver of the Year; and Lawrence Scanlon, Junior Lifesaver of the Year. The Golden Cap Award went to Joshua Van Dyk, and the Member Services Award went to Paul Russell. Adam New was named Most Outstanding IRB Operator. Ken Smith was awarded Most Outstanding Instructor. Dane Sutton was awarded Open Ski Paddler of the Year. Charlotte Bowmer was awarded Swimmer of the Year. Noah Steiner was awarded Board Paddler of the Year. Kyle Mason was awarded Beach Athlete of the Year.

The Masters Awards recognised Robyn Lester as Master Beach Athlete of the Year, Michael Georgaris as Master Water Athlete of the Year and Nick Middleton as Iron Person of the Year. In leadership roles, Layla White received the Beach Captain's Award, Ben Sutton received the Champion Lifesaver Captain's Award and Deborah Wallis received the March Past Captains Award. The Boat Captain's Award went to William Cregan and Molly Parker, and Olivia Dalgliesh was named Most Improved Junior Boat Rower.

The Boat Crew of the Year—the Wanda Weapons—included Matthew Pescud, Jack Spooner, Hayden Ward and Bradley Querzoli. Nathan Spinner was the sweep. Emily Caterson and Isaac Lo were named R&R Competitors of the Year, and the open male R&R team—Colin Jones, Kurt Melville, Stuart Smith, Grant Sandstrom, Brock Douglas, with Gordon McKirdy as coach—received the Most Consistent and Improved Team Award.

Brett Porteous was recognised as IRB Captain, a vital role in coordinating water safety and rescue. In youth development, we saw: Under 15 Most Improved, Lawrence Scanlon and Ella McGuinness; Under 15 Most Outstanding, Ryan Harris and Kyah Gallen; Under 17 Most Improved, Rhys Wakeham and Jess Henville; Under 17 Most Outstanding, Kyle Mason, Dane Sutton, Charlotte Bowmer and Mia Greacen; Under 19 Most Consistent, Will Steiner and Sienna Alderson; and Under 19 Most Outstanding, Joel Steiner and India Hulbert. The Open Most Outstanding awards went to Kai Hammond and Emma Blanch. Finally, Jeff 'Charlie' Brown was named Volunteer Coach of the Year, and Natasha Seidel received Official of the Year.

These names represent more than just awards. They represent hours of patrols, mornings of trainings and years of contribution. The impact of Wanda Surf Life Saving Club reaches every corner of the Sutherland Shire, whether it's keeping our beaches safe or mentoring the next generation of leaders. To all award recipients, congratulations.
