Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (11:44): What's really going on here? We've got a desperate attempt to change the media narrative by the Labor government, who are so bereft of ideas, so bereft of things to say and so bereft of things to bring up that they go clutching at a scare campaign on the NBN. Average Australians are facing a cost-of-living crisis. Many of Australia's businesses are facing an energy crisis and a cost-of-business crisis. There are big issues, like gambling reform, that we should be addressing and discussing. But, unfortunately, those members across the chamber cannot get these issues up in their party room and cannot get aligned perspectives, so, instead, they cynically cook up an NBN scare campaign.

The irony is that, as they're pushing a bill to stop misinformation, they cynically come up with an NBN scare campaign when there's nothing here. We discussed it: 'What is this? What do they want to talk about? We've never heard of it.' Our shadow minister for communications had not even been reached out to or briefed on the National Broadband Network Companies Amendment (Commitment to Public Ownership) Bill 2024 before it was brought on. So what you're seeing here is a scare campaign to try and change a media narrative about a government that's running out of steam, that is flailing and that is failing to address the very real issues that everyday Australians are facing.

Real incomes are down nine per cent. What does that mean? People can buy nine per cent less than they could two years ago. Inflation is still stubbornly high at 3.4 per cent, and people's mortgages are still incredibly high. Interest rates are at 4.75 per cent. They're going down everywhere else in the world, but not here. We could be talking about these issues. We could be talking about gambling reform, months after the widely acclaimed Murphy report was accepted. The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech, has said what the coalition would be doing on gambling. Yet we're still waiting for Labor's position. We could be talking about that today.

I would much rather be talking about gambling reform today—taking a moral stance on gambling and actually addressing a problem that's affecting millions of Australians. I'm sick of explaining to my kids, during live sport, why they should be talking about the first try scorer. I'd love to be debating legislation that actually addresses an issue that's facing everyday Australians and solving a problem that everyday Australians face. Instead, we're talking about a non-event. We are talking about misinformation: 'How can we distract Australians from the problems they have and the crisis this government's in?' It's sad, it's cynical and it's disappointing.

I've only been in the House for a very short time, but it is disappointing. We could be talking about how to make this place more efficient. I, at least, believe—and I think the Australian public believe—we have better things to be talking about than this.

Ms Stanley interjecting—

Mr KENNEDY: You might scoff over there, but I don't know why. If you're speaking next, I'd love you to explain to me why we're talking about something we don't have a policy on. Deputy Speaker Freelander, if they're scoffing over there, I'd like to understand why we're talking about something we don't even have a policy on.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Dr Freelander ): I don't think there was any scoffing at all.

Mr KENNEDY: My apologies if I misinterpreted that, but that's how I interpreted it. This is nothing but a distraction, and it brings out the lack of economic credibility. It was actually mid-afternoon before the shadow minister for communications was engaged on this, despite the debate being brought on by the Prime Minister in an attempt to change the media narrative. The only problem is that the media has seen through this. It's not getting picked up, it's not getting any buy-in and it's not getting any cut-through. We debated the bill for two hours before the briefing of the shadow communications minister was to get underway, so desperate are they to try and create a wedge or a public headline.

This isn't the first time we've had scare campaigns. People will remember the 'Mediscare' campaign. It actually worked. It was much closer to an election, but it worked; it did pull votes away. But this is not working. People have seen this movie before, and they're looking straight through it. The Australian people have looked through this distraction, and they're much more focused on the cost of living. They're much more focused on how they're going to pay their mortgage and much more focused on why energy bills continue to go up—and will continue to go up—after this one-off subsidy runs out.

Everyday Australians will not forget that they were promised a $275 reduction on their energy bills. Instead, the average Australian household in New South Wales and in my electorate is facing energy prices that have risen by over 20 per cent since Labor came to office—not a $275 reduction, but a 20 per cent increase. That has left some households more than $1,000 poorer a year. They were promised their mortgages would be better. The Prime Minister said that in the lead-up to the election. That hasn't happened. Interest rates are through the roof. Inflation is stubbornly high. Interest rates are coming down in New Zealand, Canada and the US. They're not coming down here. Why? It's because of the persistent government spending. The Reserve Bank is trying to keep a foot on the brake. That's why they're leaving interest rates where they are. Meanwhile, with its loose fiscal policy, this government is jamming its foot on the accelerator, the economy is shuddering and staggering, and everyday Australians are left bearing the price. It's mortgage-holders and renters in our society who those across the aisle claim to represent and want to help the most. But these are the people getting smashed up and crushed in the cost-of-living crisis. It's people in the outer Western Sydney suburbs, the outer regions of Melbourne and the peri-urban and rural areas in the rest of our states and territories.

If you wanted more evidence that this bill is not real—normally, you get a briefing as part of the consideration of the bill, and we go through normal internal processes. This did not happen. We will review this bill in the usual way, but the farcical approach from this government is to do things the other way around. We've brought it on for debate; the Prime Minister got up and started talking about it before we'd even seen it or had a chance to talk about it. It's 'debate first, consult second'. It's a silly stunt, and that's all it is—a stunt. There's no need for it. We would much rather be focused on things we could work on in a bipartisan manner, like getting the NDIS under control. I get flooded with requests for the NDIS. People talk about getting funding cut, not getting funding, or getting abused. I'd love to work out how we can fix some of these endemic problems with the NDIS, like we did on aged care, where there was a bipartisan approach. We actually are getting the aged-care sector under control fiscally.

The nonmarket sector of our economy is now the highest it has ever been. That means things like health care and child care. They're all very important things, but as that part of the economy grows, it's crowding out the business sector, or the market sector of the economy, which actually makes money and provides taxation revenue to pay for all these things. Why don't we sit down and talk about this, or about how to improve productivity in this country? Productivity is down seven per cent. Why does productivity matter? If you look at the last 30 years of Australia and at all the wealth and improvement in our living standards, 80 per cent of the increase in gross national income has come from productivity. That means, from the same amount of input or labour, you get more output. That is what productivity does. But productivity for the last two years is down 7Â½ per cent. That means, for the same amount of labour, you produce 7Â½ per cent less. That is unheralded. We have never had that in the history of our country. What does that mean? It means average Australian households get poorer. We would have been in a recession for a year and a half without immigration. The only way this country is not shrinking as an economy is from bringing more people in. We're not growing the wealth of the people existing here; we're just bringing more people in. So Coles, Woolies and CBA just have more customers—more people buying capsicums! That's how people are growing profits at the moment. It is just because of more people coming into the country, not because we're investing in productivity and growing wealth.

We could be talking about this. We really could. And I would love it. I would love to be able to tell my constituents and my former colleagues we're dealing with real, tough issues in parliament for the good of the nation. But, instead, we've brought on this bill about the NBN without consulting without consulting the opposition first. We're having a debate on it without consulting. We're wasting everybody's time. We're wasting the parliament's time and the public's time instead of actually focusing on issues that are hurting this country. Don't we know there are a lot of them! Gambling reform is another one. I would love to see this brought on. The coalition has come out with a policy. I think it's abhorrent. I get emails and calls from my electorate from people who are sick of having gambling ads in live sport all day every day, just like the grand final last weekend—or two weekends ago, if you were watching the AFL. Wouldn't we love to see a clear policy position on it?

We had the bipartisan Murphy report; it was bipartisan. This is something that the Liberal Party and the Labor Party agreed on—the Murphy report. We agreed on the recommendations; the changes we should make to gambling advertising were unanimously put forward. Yet those opposite are unable to bring a coherent policy—are unable to govern. This is the ultimate test, and, coming into an election within the next 12 months, it is not a good test to see them cooking up an NBN scare campaign—something we have no policy on; something we have not debated; something we have not been consulted on. We would love to be debating these real issues, and it is incredibly unfortunate that I'm now filling time on a topic that has no real substance.

Ms Plibersek: You don't have to; you can sit down earlier if you want.

Mr KENNEDY: Well, the Prime Minister could have sat down earlier too, and we would not be here.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Dr Freelander ): Order. Through the chair, please.

Mr KENNEDY: Mr Deputy Speaker, those opposite are telling me I could sit down earlier. The Prime Minister could have sat down earlier—

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, order. The member for Werriwa, on a point of order?

Ms Stanley: Yes, a point of order, Deputy Speaker: 76—seeing as the member for Cook is having trouble staying relevant and finding something to say, maybe he could finish his contribution.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thank the member for Werriwa. I think that the member for Cook was, in broad terms, trying to be relevant. So the member for Cook can continue.

Mr KENNEDY: I'll go straight back to this bill. The irony of this bill—and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I'll address and try and go straight back to the bill, to the member 's concerns—is: it's their own bill from 2011. They had the time, if they thought there was something in that bill, when it was drafted, or to amend it shortly afterwards. Why is it that now this has become such a big issue?

The Prime Minister had the opportunity to address issues that mattered before he flew out of the country. He saw this as the biggest priority before he left the country yesterday—to bring this on. I'd love to see him explain to the country why this is the biggest, most pressing problem: something on the NBN—a word he had uttered only six times since the election, five of them to sledge the coalition about copper. He'd uttered the word 'NBN' six times since taking office as the Prime Minister, five of them to sledge us, and now suddenly this bill has come up, as this government is flailing around. We would much rather deal with our homegrown inflation crisis. It's stubbornly high, at 3.4 per cent—still outside of the RBA zone and still much higher than where we can cut or reduce interest rates.

Under this government's watch, we've actually seen a major decline in the NBN. The previous speaker was telling the House, 'We may not be able to find a local buyer for it.' Well, what a decline we've seen under them. Australians are being hammered with price increases. Service increases aren't going better. We're seeing people go to Starlink. We've seen six million families smashed by NBN price increases of up to 14 per cent.

Australians have dealt with a double whammy of higher internet costs with two price hikes in the space of just eight months since the Albanese government backed a new pricing deal for the NBN last year. We're not talking about that. And what did the communications minister say about this? Infamously, she described these price rises as 'great news for consumers'.

The NBN's satellite business is collapsing. Two years ago, the NBN had more than 120,000 satellite customers, and Starlink had virtually none. Today, the NBN is down to 85,000 customers, so it has shrunk 33 per cent, and Starlink has gone from zero to 270,000 customers. So, under the watch of those across the aisle, the NBN is leaking customers, leaking value and increasing prices. And the last member, in his own speech, was saying he didn't think there would be a buyer within Australia for it. That's not a very good advertisement for the management under this government, is it?

So I would ask the government to return to issues, even bipartisan issues, whether on gambling or on making this place more efficient—which I, personally, would like to work on—rather than discussing farcical bills.

Debate adjourned.

Leave granted for second reading debate to resume at a later hour.
