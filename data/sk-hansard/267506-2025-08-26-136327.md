Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (13:33): This government is the worst government in the last 20 years on emissions reduction. You know who achieved a greater emissions reduction than this government? Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. Emissions have gone down less under Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen. I think I've discovered finally why Chris Bowen goes so red in question time. He's embarrassed, and he should be because prices are upâ€”

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Ms Claydon ): I will remind the member to use correct titles.

Mr KENNEDY: Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker; I withdraw that. Prices are up, emissions are flat, and they're nowhere near the Renewable Energy Target. But don't worry. Don't worry out there. Who can we trust to set a 2035 target in just a few weeks' time? That is the worst performing government in 20 years on emissions. That's who we are entrusting Australia to. That is who we are asking to legislate a 2035 target: the people who promise a lot but deliver zero.

It's no wonder they want to talk about batteries. I have to admire this government for its politics, because when you jack energy prices up sky high you then realise batteries aren't economical to sell to people, so you subsidise those batteries with the money Australians pay you to reduce the electricity prices that you've jacked up. The politics is astounding. Congratulations! No wonder you want to talk about the coalition, because a look in the mirror is pretty ugly.
