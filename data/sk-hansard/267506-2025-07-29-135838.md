Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (16:54): I want to acknowledge the Cronulla Gropers. Every morning before dawn you'll find them on the water's edge at Cronulla Beachâ€”no medals, no races, just a group of men having a swim, a coffee and a chat. Founded by Jason Dorahy and Lee Murphy, the Gropers have created a space where men can connect, free of judgement, free of pressure and grounded in mutual respect. What began with just two mates has grown to 277 members, a remarkable testament to the need for connection and the strength of community led support, and I'm proud to be member 252.

At a time when men's health remains a national challenge, the Gropers provide routine. They provide connection and a reason to show up, and they keep each other well. Six men die by suicide each day in this country. The Gropers aren't a clinical service, but what they offer is just as vital. They show that community, friendship and accountability can change lives. In a world where so many are isolated, what the Gropers have built on the sand at Cronulla is a grassroots model for connection and care.

Also, while the NDIS has been a proud national achievement rooted in dignity, fairness and support, unfortunately we've recently had policy rushed and disconnected from reality, and people in my electorate are suffering. From 1 July, the Albanese government imposed sweeping NDIS pricing changes. Physiotherapy was cut by $10 an hour. Dietetics and podiatry were reduced by $5 an hour, and travel reimbursement was halved. This was done with less than a month's notice. There was no time to plan and no genuine consultation.

In my electorate of Cook, I've received a joint submission from Kidiotherapy clinicians and one of their local families. This local family and their teenage daughter, who lives with cerebral palsy, have relied on the same physio for nearly a decade. This is care that has helped her work, care that has helped her absolutely excel at school and thrive. Their message is simple: this is not where you cut. Physiotherapy isn't a luxury. It prevents hospitalisations, supports dignity and saves lives.

The coalition has called for a three-month deferral, urgent consultation and full transparency on the data that sits behind these cuts. This isn't about business margins; it's about protecting people and giving them dignity. I will fight to ensure the NDIS puts people, not price tags, first.
