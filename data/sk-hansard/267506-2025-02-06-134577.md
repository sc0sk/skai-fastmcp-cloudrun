Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (16:02): The member for Swan said Labor has a plan and also talked about accountability. Well, right now we've got a Labor federal government and almost wall-to-wall Labor governments across our states, and, sadly, a plan is not good enough for everyday Australians. Australians are sick of plans. They want and need action.

I'm reminded of what Mike Tyson said: 'Everyone's got a plan until they're punched in the face.' The Australian economy has punched this government squarely in the face. Why? Once, more than half of all adults under 29 owned homes in Australia—half, 50 per cent. That number has now plummeted to less than 30 per cent. This government's inaction now has Australians fearing for their future. It has Australians fearing for their children's future. We have a crisis that has stolen hope from Australians, a crisis that's leading Australians to skip meals.

Of course Aussies want to own their homes—even renters. Even though we're addicted to the build-to-rent scheme, 94 per cent of renters aspire to owning their own home. So why aren't we delivering what these people want? Instead of delivering them hopeless build-to-rent schemes, why don't we give them pathways to actually purchasing their own homes?

So what's gone wrong? House prices have not kept up with wages. In Cook I hear heartbreaking stories all the time. Just last month I heard a story of two teachers who could no longer afford to live in my electorate and so were packing up and moving their family. They're moving away from their parents. It's not funny. I see people smiling over there. This is not funny. They were not laughing when they came to see me about having to move away from their parents and their jobs because they couldn't afford their home loan.

Ms Lawrence interjecting—

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Ms Claydon ): The member for Hasluck!

Mr KENNEDY: No-one in my electorate is laughing about that, and I'd encourage the member for Hasluck not to laugh either.

This problem has only got worse under your government. Since Anthony Albanese came to power, the average cost of a mortgage—

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Member for Cook, just a moment. If you direct your comments through me and the member for Hasluck stops the interjections, we might actually get this debate going.

Mr KENNEDY: I'd love for the interjections to stop. The problem has got worse since Mr Albanese came to government. The average mortgage has increased $50,000 a year. Rents are 17 per cent up. They're paying 17 per cent more, yet they want to own their own home. House prices are up by double digits as well, and the inflationary spending of this government is keeping interest rates high, piling on the pain to everyday Aussies. Housing is up 13.5 per cent, but what has happened to real disposable income? That family that came to see me about moving to WA because they could no longer afford their mortgage—well, their disposable income is down nine per cent. That means they've got nine per cent less to spend on groceries, nine per cent less to spend on food, nine per cent less to spend on insurance. They've got nine per cent less to spend, yet food is up 12 per cent, insurance is up 17 per cent and gas is up 34 per cent.

In the middle of a housing crisis, when not enough Aussies can get to own homes, what has happened? We have abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. And what's happened to construction costs? They are sky high. We've let 1.6 million people into Australia in the middle of a housing crisis. We have the fastest growth in immigration since 1952. According to the Master Builders Association, there are 3,605 small construction businesses in my electorate who are struggling, many hitting the wall. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, in the middle of a housing crisis, when we should be building more, these construction companies are going broke.

The coalition has a plan to address this national crisis, and it will: super for housing. We will let first home buyers put $50,000 of their money towards their own home. Yes, it's their money. I know it's news to those across the floor, but super is their money, and we'll let them put it towards their homes. We'll put a ban on foreign investors and temporary residents purchasing homes in Australia. We will reduce the permanent migration program by 25 per cent because we know that will reduce demand for housing. Do those on the other side want to keep that going up? Do you want those people to outcompete Australians for homes? I assume that's a yes. Not only will we do that; we will also ensure we have enough temporary skilled visas and workers to come in and build these homes. Lastly, we will invest $5 billion to unlock 500,000 new homes to get this country moving again.
