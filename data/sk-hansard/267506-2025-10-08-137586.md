Mr KENNEDY (Cook) (16:21): We just heard the member talking about how well this government is doing on energy and climate. We've just heard how well they're doing and how much they're doing. They have the National EV Strategy, the performance strategy and the energy strategy. We've heard how much they care about emissions and climate change. For all that effort, all that work in 3½ years, and emissions are barely down one per cent. Doesn't that alarm you? Given your strategies, the amount of capital and the amount of energy you are putting into this, emissions are down by one per cent. Doesn't it alarm you that Tony Abbott lowered emissions more than you, that Malcolm Turnbull lowered emissions more than you? They didn't even serve full terms. Scott Morrison lowered emissions four to five times more than you. I would be alarmed. Don't you question whether your policy is actually built on a house of cards? The last three Liberal prime ministers lowered emissions far more than you. Yes, take your notes, but it's true. Go and check it out and come back and explain to the Australian people why that's the case.

An honourable member interjecting—

Mr KENNEDY: Was Tony Abbott there during COVID? I'll take the interjection. Why did Tony Abbott lower emissions more than you?

An honourable member interjecting—

Mr KENNEDY: From whenever.

Mr Josh Wilson interjecting—

Mr KENNEDY: Why did Malcolm Turnbull lower emissions more than you? Why did Scott Morrison lower emissions more than you? You've lowered them by one per cent. It's pathetic.

Mr Josh Wilson interjecting—

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Dr Haines ): Order! The assistant minister will resist. I cannot hear the member for Cook. Could you proceed, please?

Mr KENNEDY: They have not lowered emissions at all. It's a pathetic record. And you've got a blank cheque. You said that you haven't been asked a budget question. Well, here's one, and answer it. Tell us what the capacity investment mechanism is going to cost? I'll take the interjection. Crickets! Australia, that's what we've just heard. I asked the question: what is the capacity mechanism going to cost? This was the response I received, 'Pff!'. Well, that's not good enough, Australia. That's not good enough. You've got people spending blank cheques. You've got people actually flatlining emissions. You've got people who don't have any credible way to get to a 2030 emissions target or a 2035 emissions target. Well, Australia, we've had enough.

Not only are we not getting anywhere near the emissions target; we are paying through the nose. Energy prices are up 40 per cent—up 40 per cent! I'm one of the few electorates that still has a few manufacturing businesses clinging to life. FJP Manufacturing, a local metal manufacturing firm that I visit, has declining revenues. They're hanging on. They're trying to manufacture. They're employing trade-skilled workers—people you should care about, or at least pretend to care about, with free TAFE or whatever else your virtue signalling. Well, their electricity went up 25 per cent last year, and it's going up 41 per cent this year. What message do you have for them?

An honourable member interjecting—

Mr KENNEDY: I'll take the interjection. With their electricity going up 76 per cent, what is the message you would like to give to them? What about HF Powdercoating? Another company whose electricity is going up 46 per cent this year, with a 44 per cent increase on gas the year before. What message do you have for these manufacturers? Where's your future made in Australia? Where's the help—where is it? Where's your capacity investment mechanism? That's been my interjection of the day—'What's the capacity investment mechanism going to cost?' Do you have an answer?

A government member: Of course!

Mr KENNEDY: What is it? Oh, you don't have it. Why is this government deliberately driving up costs, strangling Australian businesses like FJP Manufacturing and HF Powdercoating in my electorate? They don't have answers for them. They don't have answers. They have policies that are driving up the cost, and this whole energy strategy, this whole emissions-reduction portfolio, is built on a house of cards. That is why every day in question time we listen to Chris Bowen. What's the only thing he talks about? His battery program

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Dr Haines ): The member for Cook will use the minister's correct title, please.

Mr KENNEDY: Sorry. We listen to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy—I forgot who he was, since he wasn't here today! He can't even turn up to his own budget or appropriation hearing in the Fed Chamber. It's pathetic. Neither can the minister for energy. We turn up there everyday, and, instead of actually talking about how emissions are going and instead of talking about what's happening to energy costs, all we hear about is how many batteries he's been able to sell because he's jacked up the energy prices in those electorates like it's some great achievement. Guess what? If you jack up energy prices 40 per cent in 2½ years, you're going to sell a few more batteries. That's not an achievement. It's something you should be embarrassed about.
