| `summary` | `title` | Used as title (truncated to 500 chars) |
| `electorate` | `state` | Direct copy (optional) |
| `utterance_id` | `speech_id` | Used as unique identifier |
| `source_file` + `utterance_id` | `hansard_reference` | Combined for reference |

## Files Converted

All 64 speeches by Simon Kennedy (Cook electorate) from May 2024 - October 2025:

- **Maiden speech**: 2024-05-28
- **Policy speeches**: Housing, healthcare, economics, energy
- **Community acknowledgements**: Local events and constituents
- **Parliamentary debates**: Budget, legislation, amendments

## Validation

All converted files have been validated against the `SpeechFrontmatter` Pydantic model:

✅ Required fields present (speech_id, speaker, party, chamber, date, title)
✅ Party values match PartyEnum (Liberal, Labor, Greens, National, Independent)
✅ Chamber values match ChamberEnum (REPS, SENATE)
✅ Dates in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
✅ Title length ≤ 500 characters
✅ Optional fields (state, hansard_reference) included where available

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Ingestion (Small Batch)
Use Claude Code CLI to ingest individual files for testing:

```bash
claude "ingest the markdown file at /home/user/skai-fastmcp-cloudrun/data/hansard_converted/267506-2024-05-28-129006.md"
```

### Option 2: Bulk Ingestion (Production)
Once Phase 5 (`ingest_markdown_bulk` tool) is implemented, use:

```bash
claude "ingest all markdown files in /home/user/skai-fastmcp-cloudrun/data/hansard_converted/"
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Cloud Run
The converted files can be uploaded to Cloud Run's file system or Cloud Storage, then ingested via the production MCP server with proper OAuth 2.1 authentication.
