The dream of home ownership is slipping further from reach for young Australians, with median house prices in Sydney now exceeding $1.2 million. This is not just a statistic - it represents real families struggling to provide stable housing for their children.

The government must take immediate action on multiple fronts. First, we need to increase housing supply by fast-tracking planning approvals and releasing more Commonwealth land for development. Second, we must provide targeted support for first-home buyers through expanded grants and stamp duty concessions. Third, we need to address investor incentives that distort the market and price out owner-occupiers.

In Cook, we've seen rental vacancy rates drop below 1%, forcing families into increasingly precarious housing situations. This is unacceptable in a wealthy nation like Australia. I call on the government to bring forward comprehensive housing reform legislation before the end of this parliamentary session. Our young people deserve better than a future of perpetual renting.""",

        "full_text": """Mr Speaker, Australia has always been a nation built on immigration, but we must ensure our immigration system serves the national interest while maintaining our humanitarian commitments. Recent processing delays and backlogs have created uncertainty for legitimate applicants while potential security risks slip through inadequate vetting processes.

The current skilled migration program fails to address critical workforce shortages in regional areas. My electorate of Cook hosts numerous healthcare facilities desperately seeking qualified nurses and allied health professionals, yet the points system prioritizes urban occupations. We need a regional visa program that directs skilled migrants to areas of genuine need.

Furthermore, our refugee and humanitarian program must be reformed to prioritize those facing the greatest persecution while maintaining strong border security. The current system is plagued by long processing times and inconsistent decision-making. I propose establishing fast-track processing for refugees with established community ties and employment prospects, combined with enhanced security screening protocols.

National security and compassion are not mutually exclusive. With proper policy design, we can welcome those who will contribute to our nation while protecting our borders and maintaining community cohesion. I urge the government to establish a bipartisan committee to develop comprehensive immigration reform legislation.""",

        "full_text": """Mr Speaker, I stand today to advocate for urgent infrastructure investment in Cook and across Sydney's south. Our region has experienced significant population growth, yet essential infrastructure has failed to keep pace. Commuters face overcrowded trains, roads are congested, and digital connectivity remains inadequate in several suburbs.

The government's recent infrastructure announcement failed to include critical projects for Cook, including the extension of the M6 motorway and upgrades to Sutherland Station. These projects are not just about convenience - they're about economic productivity and quality of life. Every hour our constituents waste in traffic is time taken from their families and communities.

I call for immediate commitment to three priority projects: First, complete the M6 extension to connect our community to the broader motorway network. Second, upgrade rail infrastructure at Sutherland and Miranda stations to accommodate increased passenger volumes. Third, accelerate the rollout of high-speed broadband infrastructure to enable remote work and digital businesses.

Infrastructure investment creates jobs, boosts economic growth, and improves living standards. For every dollar invested in productive infrastructure, we see returns through increased economic activity and reduced congestion costs. The government must move beyond short-term budget constraints and take a long-term view of nation-building. Our children deserve communities connected by world-class infrastructure.""",

        "full_text": """Mr Speaker, climate change is the defining challenge of our generation, and we must act with both urgency and pragmatism. Coastal communities in Cook are already experiencing the impacts - rising sea levels threaten our beaches, extreme weather events damage infrastructure, and changing weather patterns affect our natural environment.

The path forward requires balancing emissions reduction with economic reality. We cannot shut down our economy overnight, but we can accelerate the transition to clean energy while supporting workers in transitioning industries. I propose a three-pillar approach: First, massive investment in renewable energy infrastructure, including offshore wind farms along our coast. Second, support for clean technology manufacturing to create jobs while reducing emissions. Third, adaptation measures to protect vulnerable coastal communities.

In Cook, we have the opportunity to lead on climate action. Our coastal location makes us ideal for offshore wind development. Our educated workforce can drive clean technology innovation. Our community spirit can mobilize grassroots climate action. But we need government support - funding for renewable infrastructure, incentives for household solar and batteries, and planning reforms to enable climate adaptation.

Some say climate action will destroy our economy. I say inaction will cost far more. The insurance industry already prices climate risk into premiums. The global economy is moving toward decarbonization. Australia can lead this transition or be left behind. I choose leadership. I choose a sustainable future for Cook and for Australia.""",

        "hansard_reference": "House Hansard, 14 February 2025, p. 1245",
        "full_text": """Mr Speaker, education is the foundation of opportunity, yet our schools face a funding crisis that threatens educational outcomes for thousands of students in Cook. Public schools operate with aging infrastructure, insufficient resources, and growing class sizes while demand continues to rise.

The current funding model disadvantages public schools in outer suburban areas like Cook. Our schools serve diverse communities with complex needs - including students from disadvantaged backgrounds, English language learners, and students with disabilities - yet receive less per-student funding than wealthy private schools. This is fundamentally unfair and undermines educational equity.

I call for immediate review of school funding formulas to ensure needs-based allocation. Schools with higher proportions of disadvantaged students should receive additional resources, not less. Furthermore, we need capital investment in school infrastructure - science labs, libraries, digital learning facilities - to prepare students for 21st century careers.

Teacher shortages compound these challenges. We're losing experienced educators to burnout and better-paid opportunities. The solution requires both increased teacher salaries and improved working conditions. Teachers are professionals who shape our nation's future - they deserve professional pay and respect.

I also advocate for expanded vocational education opportunities in secondary schools. Not every student will pursue university, and we must provide clear pathways to skilled trades and technical careers. Partnership with local businesses and TAFEs can create work-integrated learning opportunities.

Our children are our most precious resource. Skimping on education funding is the ultimate false economy. Every dollar invested in quality education returns multiples through increased productivity, reduced social costs, and stronger communities. I urge the government to commit to fully-funded, needs-based public education.""",

        "hansard_reference": "House Hansard, 28 March 2025, p. 2678",
        "full_text": """Mr Speaker, small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy, yet they face mounting challenges that threaten their viability. In Cook, local businesses struggle with rising rents, regulatory complexity, and digital transformation requirements while competing against multinational corporations with vast resources.

The government must do more to level the playing field. First, we need tax reform that recognizes the unique challenges small businesses face. The instant asset write-off should be made permanent and expanded to support investment in technology and equipment. Second, we must reduce red tape that costs small businesses thousands of hours annually in compliance work. A single business identifier should replace the maze of registrations currently required.

Access to capital remains a critical barrier for small business growth. While major corporations enjoy cheap credit, small businesses face stringent lending criteria and high interest rates. I propose a Small Business Investment Fund to provide low-interest loans for businesses with solid prospects but limited collateral. This would unlock growth and job creation across our economy.

Digital transformation is essential but expensive. Many small businesses lack the capital and expertise to establish e-commerce capabilities, digital marketing, and modern payment systems. The government should provide grants and technical support to help small businesses go digital, ensuring they can compete in the modern economy.

Cook's retail precincts, including Miranda and Caringbah, host hundreds of small businesses that create local jobs and community connections. These businesses deserve government support, not just lip service. I call for a comprehensive Small Business Support Package that includes tax reform, reduced red tape, improved access to capital, and digital transformation assistance. Our economy depends on small business success.""",

        "chamber": "House of Representatives",
        "electorate": "Cook",

        "date": date(2025, 5, 15),
        "hansard_reference": "House Hansard, 15 May 2025, p. 3892",
        "full_text": """Mr Speaker, access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right, yet Australians increasingly struggle to see a doctor, access specialist care, or afford essential medications. In Cook, bulk-billing rates have plummeted, emergency department wait times have blown out, and elective surgery backlogs continue growing.

The crisis in general practice demands immediate attention. As bulk-billing rates collapse, more Australians delay seeking medical care due to cost, leading to worse health outcomes and higher long-term costs. The Medicare rebate freeze effectively cut GP incomes in real terms, forcing many to charge gap fees. We must unfreeze Medicare rebates and implement a comprehensive GP sustainability package.

Hospital overcrowding reflects both inadequate funding and poor coordination between federal and state governments. Cook residents face multi-hour emergency department waits for conditions that should be managed in primary care. This indicates systemic failure, not individual hospital problems. We need integrated care models that keep people healthy and out of hospital through better chronic disease management and preventive care.

Mental health services remain woefully inadequate despite growing demand. Young people in Cook wait months to access psychologists and psychiatrists, while crisis services are overwhelmed. I call for expanded mental health services, including more Medicare-subsidized psychology sessions and investment in community mental health teams.

Pharmaceutical costs burden many households, particularly those managing chronic conditions requiring multiple medications. While the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a world-leading program, more can be done to reduce out-of-pocket costs and ensure timely access to new medicines.

A healthy population is a productive population. Healthcare is not just a cost - it's an investment in our nation's future. I urge the government to commit to sustainable Medicare funding, increased hospital capacity, expanded mental health services, and affordable pharmaceutical access. All Australians deserve quality healthcare regardless of their postcode or bank balance.""",
