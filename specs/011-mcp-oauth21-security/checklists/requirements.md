# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP OAuth 2.1 Compliance and Security Hardening

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification correctly focuses on WHAT (OAuth 2.1 compliance, security controls) and WHY (MCP spec requirements, vulnerability fixes) without specifying HOW (specific libraries, code structure).

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 44 functional requirements are written in testable format with clear MUST/SHOULD statements. Success criteria include specific metrics (100ms latency, 10 attempts/60s rate limit, 300s TTL). Edge cases cover 10 scenarios including JWKS outages, clock skew, and secret rotation.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Six user stories cover all priority levels (P1: JWT/JWKS, Secret Management, Algorithm Protection, Rate Limiting; P2: Introspection; P3: Dev Utilities). Each story includes independent testing criteria and acceptance scenarios.

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

**Quality Score**: 100% (16/16 checklist items passed)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of MCP 2025 OAuth 2.1 requirements
- Clear prioritization with justification for each user story
- Detailed edge case analysis (10 scenarios)
- Strong security focus with 17 security-specific requirements
- Well-defined success criteria with measurable metrics
- Clear assumptions and out-of-scope items
- Technology-agnostic throughout

**Areas for Attention During Implementation**:
- Rate limiting implementation must be thread-safe (FR-043)
- Secret caching requires TTL management logic (FR-024, FR-025)
- HTTPS validation must differentiate between prod/dev environments (FR-015, FR-016)
- Production environment detection needs multiple signals (FR-036)
- Token hash logging requires consistent implementation across all log statements (FR-014)

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Proceed to `/speckit.plan`** - No clarifications needed, specification is implementation-ready.
