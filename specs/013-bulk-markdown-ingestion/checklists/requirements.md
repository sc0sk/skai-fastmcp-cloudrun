# Specification Quality Checklist: Bulk Markdown Directory Ingestion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ 3 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- ✅ 13 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-013) - all testable
- ✅ 7 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) - all measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified
- ✅ Clear dependencies on Feature 012 documented
- ✅ Out of scope items explicitly listed
- ✅ Assumptions documented for context

No clarifications needed - all requirements can be planned and implemented as specified.
