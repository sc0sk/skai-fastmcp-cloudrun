# Specification Quality Checklist: OAuth 2.1 Compliance

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All checklist items pass**

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- Specification focuses on OAuth 2.1 compliance from user perspective (ChatGPT authentication, developer testing)
- No technology-specific implementation details included
- Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- No clarification markers present
- All 8 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (100% success rate, under 5 seconds, zero failures)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of middleware, frameworks)
- All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover parameter handling scenarios
- Scope is clear: OAuth 2.1 compliance with RFC 8707 support
- No external dependencies identified (self-contained feature)

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios
- Three prioritized user scenarios (P1: ChatGPT, P2: OAuth 2.0 compatibility, P3: Inspector testing)
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks` without requiring `/speckit.clarify`.
