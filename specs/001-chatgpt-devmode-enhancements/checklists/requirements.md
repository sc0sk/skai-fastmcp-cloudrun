# Specification Quality Checklist

**Feature**: ChatGPT Developer Mode Enhancements
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Spec Path**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Completeness Criteria

- [x] **User Scenarios**: 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) with clear acceptance scenarios
- [x] **Functional Requirements**: 11 requirements (FR-001 to FR-011) covering tool annotations, descriptions, parameters, and GPT-5 optimization
- [x] **Success Criteria**: 6 measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-006) with quantifiable targets
- [x] **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases documented covering out-of-scope queries, parameter mismatches, and tool selection failures
- [x] **Assumptions**: 7 assumptions clearly stated, including GPT-5 model family and FastMCP version requirements
- [x] **Key Entities**: 3 entities defined (Tool Annotation, Parameter Schema, Tool Description)

## Quality Criteria

### Clarity and Specificity
- [x] User stories use clear Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- [x] Functional requirements use MUST/SHOULD language (RFC 2119 style)
- [x] Success criteria include specific percentages (95%, 100%, 50%, 75%, 90%)
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in spec
- [x] Technical terms are explained (readOnlyHint, idempotentHint, enum, ISO 8601)

### Testability
- [x] Each user story includes "Independent Test" description showing how to validate in isolation
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (can verify ChatGPT tool selection, confirmation prompts, parameter accuracy)
- [x] Edge cases can be tested with specific queries (e.g., "speeches before 2024-05-28")

### Feasibility
- [x] Requirements align with FastMCP 2.12.5+ capabilities
- [x] GPT-5 considerations document how the feature leverages GPT-5's strengths (instruction following, tool calling, reasoning)
- [x] No write operations required (all tools remain read-only, as per current implementation)
- [x] Enum values are stable and match existing dataset (parties, chambers)

### Prioritization
- [x] P1: Improved tool discoverability (foundation for all ChatGPT integration)
- [x] P2: Read-only annotations (reduces friction for read operations)
- [x] P3: Enhanced parameters with enums (improves accuracy)
- [x] P4: Tool selection guidance (prevents ambiguity with built-in tools)
- [x] Priorities explain "Why this priority" with clear rationale

## GPT-5 Alignment

- [x] Spec acknowledges GPT-5's improved instruction following
- [x] Tool descriptions designed to leverage GPT-5's reasoning capabilities
- [x] Requirements support GPT-5 preambles (FR-011)
- [x] Success criteria measure GPT-5's tool selection improvements (SC-001, SC-004)

## Known Issues / Clarifications Needed

**None**. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

## Validation Result

âœ… **PASSED** - Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for `/speckit.plan`

### Summary
- 4 user stories with clear priorities and independent tests
- 11 functional requirements (10 MUST, 1 SHOULD)
- 6 measurable success criteria
- 5 edge cases documented
- 7 assumptions stated, including GPT-5 model family support
- No clarifications needed

### Next Steps
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Review technical approach for tool annotation updates
3. Identify which tools need description enhancements (search, fetch, ingest)
