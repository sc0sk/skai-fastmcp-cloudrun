# Specification Quality Checklist: ChatGPT Developer Mode Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification ready for planning

### Validation Details

**Content Quality** ✓
- Specification is written in business language without technical implementation details
- Focuses on user experience (journalists, researchers, new users)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- Proper prioritization (P1, P2, P3) with clear rationale

**Requirement Completeness** ✓
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- 15 functional requirements, all testable (e.g., "Tool MUST include 'Use this when...' description")
- 10 success criteria with measurable metrics (e.g., "connect in under 2 minutes", "80%+ tool preference")
- 10 edge cases identified covering failure modes, dataset limitations, concurrent access
- Clear scope boundaries in Out of Scope section (authentication, rate limiting, other platforms)
- 8 dependencies documented (existing tools, Cloud Run, ChatGPT subscription, FastMCP)
- 11 assumptions listed (Developer Mode enabled, stable URL, user knowledge)

**Feature Readiness** ✓
- User Story 1 (P1): Journalist Chat Mode - independently testable with single query
- User Story 2 (P2): Deep Research Mode - independently testable with comprehensive task
- User Story 3 (P3): Connector setup - independently testable with new user
- All 15 FRs have implicit acceptance criteria in their "MUST" statements
- Success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic:
  - SC-001: "connect in under 2 minutes" (time-based, user-focused)
  - SC-004: "ChatGPT prefers MCP tools 80%+" (behavioral metric)
  - SC-006: "users rate 4/5 or higher" (satisfaction metric)

### Notes

- Specification is exceptionally complete with no gaps
- Strong emphasis on tool metadata optimization (descriptions, annotations)
- Clear differentiation between Chat Mode and Deep Research Mode use cases
- Comprehensive risk analysis (7 risks with mitigation strategies)
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning
