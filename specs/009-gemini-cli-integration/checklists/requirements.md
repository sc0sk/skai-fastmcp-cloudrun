## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-23

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on documentation deliverables (setup guides, configuration templates, testing scenarios) without specifying format, tools, or technical stack
- ✅ **User-focused**: Three prioritized user stories address developer quick-start (P1), team collaboration (P2), and self-service setup (P3)
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Setup times, success rates, troubleshooting coverage described in user/business terms
- ✅ **All sections present**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Key Entities all completed

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All 8 functional requirements specify documentation deliverables with clear scope (installation guides, config templates, troubleshooting, test scenarios)
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR verifiable through documentation review and user testing (e.g., FR-001 testable by checking installation instructions exist for all 3 platforms)
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: 5 quantified metrics (10min setup time, 15min remote config, 80% issue resolution, 100% test pass rate, 4.0+ rating)
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic SCs**: Metrics focus on user outcomes (setup time, success rate, satisfaction) not implementation (file format, hosting platform)
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios**: 9 Given-When-Then scenarios across 3 user stories covering local setup, remote integration, and documentation quality
- ✅ **Edge cases**: 6 edge cases identified (version incompatibility, connection timeouts, cold starts, auth failures, tool conflicts, database unreachability)
- ✅ **Scope boundaries**: Clear focus on documentation and configuration templates for Gemini CLI integration (both STDIO and SSE/HTTP transports)
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Clear dependencies on Gemini CLI installation, Cloud Run deployment, existing MCP server functionality

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ **FR acceptance criteria**: Each of 8 FRs specifies what documentation must contain (installation steps, config templates, test commands, troubleshooting guidance)
- ✅ **User scenario coverage**: Primary flows covered for local development, remote team usage, and self-service setup
- ✅ **Meets success criteria**: Feature design aligns with 5 measurable outcomes (fast setup, high success rate, effective troubleshooting, reliable tests, user satisfaction)
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Requirements describe documentation content and user outcomes without specifying markdown format, file structure, or hosting platform

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent

This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`. All requirements focus on deliverable documentation artifacts with clear, measurable user outcomes. The feature is entirely documentation-focused, making it low-risk and independently testable.

**Strengths**:
1. Well-prioritized user stories (P1: quick local setup, P2: team collaboration, P3: self-service documentation)
2. Specific, measurable success criteria with user testing validation
3. Comprehensive coverage of both STDIO (local) and SSE/HTTP (remote) transports
4. Clear troubleshooting and testing guidance requirements
5. Realistic time expectations (10min local, 15min remote setup)

**Recommendations for planning phase**:
- Create documentation outline with section structure
- Define configuration template JSON/YAML schema
- Specify test scenario format and execution instructions
- Identify platform-specific setup variations (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Plan user testing protocol for validation (5+ participants per SC-001)
