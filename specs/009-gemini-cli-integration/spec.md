# Feature Specification: Google Gemini CLI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `009-gemini-cli-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add Google Gemini CLI integration with comprehensive setup documentation, configuration templates, and testing guides for both local STDIO and remote SSE/HTTP transports"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Local Development with STDIO Transport (Priority: P1)

Developers can install and use the Hansard MCP server on their local machine with Gemini CLI using simple command-line configuration, enabling immediate access to parliamentary speech search capabilities without complex setup.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - enables developers to quickly test and use the Hansard tools locally. This is the foundation for all other integration modes.

**Independent Test**: Install Gemini CLI, run configuration command, execute a parliamentary speech search query, and receive results - deliverable working local setup in under 5 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Gemini CLI is installed, **When** developer runs configuration command, **Then** Hansard MCP server is added to Gemini CLI settings and tools are discoverable
2. **Given** server is configured, **When** developer asks Gemini to search parliamentary speeches about climate policy, **Then** search results are returned with relevant speeches
3. **Given** developer wants to fetch a full speech, **When** developer requests speech by ID, **Then** complete speech text and metadata are displayed

### User Story 2 - Remote Cloud Run Integration with SSE Transport (Priority: P2)

Users can connect Gemini CLI to the deployed Cloud Run Hansard MCP server using SSE transport, enabling access to the centralized database and sharing resources across team members without local server setup.

**Why this priority**: Enables team collaboration and centralized data access. Critical for production use cases where multiple users need shared access to the full Hansard database.

**Independent Test**: Configure Gemini CLI with Cloud Run SSE endpoint, authenticate, execute searches, and verify results match cloud-hosted data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Cloud Run service is deployed, **When** user configures Gemini CLI with SSE endpoint URL, **Then** connection is established and tools are available
2. **Given** SSE connection is active, **When** user performs search query, **Then** results are retrieved from cloud database in under 3 seconds
3. **Given** authentication is required, **When** user provides credentials, **Then** secure authenticated session is established

---

### User Story 3 - Comprehensive Setup Documentation (Priority: P3)

Developers and users can follow step-by-step documentation to configure both local and remote MCP server connections, troubleshoot common issues, and verify correct setup using provided test scenarios.

**Why this priority**: Reduces friction and support burden. Nice-to-have for initial launch but critical for broader adoption and self-service setup.

**Independent Test**: Follow documentation from scratch, complete setup for both STDIO and SSE transports, run test scenarios, and achieve successful configuration without external help.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user reads setup documentation, **When** following STDIO configuration steps, **Then** local server is configured correctly within 10 minutes
2. **Given** user encounters configuration error, **When** consulting troubleshooting guide, **Then** issue is identified and resolved using provided solutions
3. **Given** user wants to verify setup, **When** running provided test commands, **Then** all tests pass and confirm working configuration

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Gemini CLI version is incompatible with MCP server?
- How does system handle SSE connection timeouts or network interruptions?
- What if Cloud Run service is cold-starting when user initiates connection?
- How are authentication failures handled for remote connections?
- What if multiple MCP servers have conflicting tool names?
- How does system behave when database is unreachable during query execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST provide step-by-step installation instructions for Gemini CLI with prerequisite checks, version requirements, and platform-specific guidance (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST include complete configuration templates for local STDIO transport with environment variables, command paths, and server arguments clearly specified
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST include complete configuration templates for remote SSE/HTTP transports with Cloud Run endpoints, authentication methods, and connection parameters
- **FR-004**: Testing guides MUST provide verification commands to confirm correct setup, including sample queries and expected output formats
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include troubleshooting section covering common errors (connection failures, authentication issues, version mismatches) with diagnostic steps and solutions
- **FR-006**: Configuration templates MUST support both development (local with auth bypass) and production (Cloud Run with OAuth) scenarios
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST explain how to verify tool discovery, test each of the three Hansard tools (search, fetch, ingest), and interpret results
- **FR-008**: Setup guides MUST include performance expectations (query response times, cold start delays) and optimization recommendations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Configuration Profile**: Represents a complete Gemini CLI MCP server configuration including transport type (STDIO/SSE/HTTP), connection parameters, environment variables, authentication settings, and timeout values
- **Test Scenario**: Represents a verifiable test case including test description, command to execute, expected behavior, sample input, and success criteria for validation

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers complete local STDIO setup from documentation in under 10 minutes without external support (measured via user testing with 5+ participants)
- **SC-002**: Users successfully configure remote SSE connection and execute first query within 15 minutes following documentation (90% success rate in testing)
- **SC-003**: Documentation troubleshooting section resolves 80% of common setup issues without requiring additional support escalation
- **SC-004**: All provided test scenarios execute successfully after correct configuration (100% pass rate when setup is correct)
- **SC-005**: Users rate documentation clarity as 4.0+ out of 5.0 in comprehensibility and completeness (survey-based measurement)
