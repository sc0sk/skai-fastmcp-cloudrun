# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub OAuth Authentication and Docker Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**All checklist items passed** âœ…

The specification is complete and ready for planning. Key strengths:

1. **User-Focused**: Three prioritized user stories with clear independent test criteria
2. **Measurable Success**: All success criteria include specific metrics (time-based, percentage-based, binary checks)
3. **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on outcomes, not implementation (e.g., "completes within 30 seconds" vs "OAuth redirect works")
4. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 15 functional requirements cover authentication, containerization, and environment configuration
5. **Well-Scoped**: Clear out-of-scope items prevent scope creep
6. **Realistic Assumptions**: Documents pre-existing infrastructure requirements

**Ready to proceed with**:
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan
- Direct implementation - Specification is complete

**No clarifications needed** - Specification uses reasonable defaults based on:
- Industry-standard OAuth 2.1 flow with PKCE
- Established Docker containerization best practices
- Standard Cloud Run deployment patterns
- Documented FastMCP OAuth Proxy architecture
