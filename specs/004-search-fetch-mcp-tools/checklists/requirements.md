# Specification Quality Checklist: Search and Fetch MCP Tools

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec correctly focuses on WHAT (semantic search, speech retrieval) without specifying HOW (Python, LangChain implementation). User scenarios describe journalist, analyst, and fact-checker workflows.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 8 functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria. Success criteria include measurable outcomes (2-minute search time, 3-second response time, 100% speech reconstruction accuracy). Edge cases covered in FR-007 (error handling). Out of scope section clearly defines boundaries.

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three comprehensive user scenarios (journalist finding soundbites, analyst comparing positions, fact-checker verifying quotes) cover all primary use cases. Success criteria aligned with scenarios (2-minute find time, 5-minute verification).

---

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification ready for planning

**Strengths**:
- Excellent user scenarios with concrete actors and workflows
- 8 well-defined functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Rich metadata model documented (29 fields)
- Clear scope boundaries and dependencies
- No implementation details leaked

**Readiness**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Specification validated and complete
2. → Run `/speckit.plan` to generate technical implementation plan
3. → Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable task list
4. → Begin implementation following generated tasks

---

## Notes

- Specification assumes existing infrastructure (hansard_speeches table with 628 chunks, LangChain schema)
- All work from 002-real-hansard-ingestion preserved and committed
- New feature branch (004-search-fetch-mcp-tools) created from current state
- No conflicts with existing work - this builds on top of successful ingestion
