# Feature Specification: Error Handling & Logging Middleware

**Feature Branch**: `008-error-logging-middleware`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add error handling and improve logging using this middleware: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/middleware"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User-Friendly Error Messages (Priority: P1)

When users encounter errors, they receive clear, actionable messages that explain the problem and suggest solutions, rather than technical stack traces.

**Why this priority**: Core user experience - prevents user confusion and reduces support burden. Every tool interaction can fail, so this provides immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Trigger any tool error (invalid date format, missing parameter, database timeout) and verify error message is human-readable without technical jargon.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user searches with invalid date "2025-13-01", **When** tool executes, **Then** error message is "Invalid date format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2023-01-15)"
2. **Given** database connection temporarily fails, **When** user calls any tool, **Then** error message is "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment."
3. **Given** user provides speech ID that doesn't exist, **When** fetch tool executes, **Then** error message is "Speech not found. Please check the ID and try again."

### User Story 2 - Operator Troubleshooting (Priority: P2)

Platform operators can quickly diagnose and resolve issues using detailed structured logs with request context, stack traces, and performance metrics.

**Why this priority**: Enables faster incident response. Without this, operators struggle to understand why errors occur and how to fix them.

**Independent Test**: Trigger an error, then query logs by error ID to retrieve full stack trace, request parameters, and system state at time of failure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** search tool fails with "InvalidSyntax" error, **When** operator searches logs for error ID, **Then** log contains full stack trace, search query, user ID, and database state
2. **Given** ingest operation takes 8 seconds, **When** operator reviews logs, **Then** performance warning logged with time breakdown: validation (0.2s), chunking (1.5s), embedding (5.8s), storage (0.5s)
3. **Given** same error occurs 50 times in 2 minutes, **When** operator reviews logs, **Then** sees summary: "DatabaseConnectionError occurred 50 times (2024-01-15 10:30-10:32)"

---

### User Story 3 - Performance Monitoring (Priority: P3)

System automatically identifies and logs slow operations, enabling proactive performance optimization before users complain.

**Why this priority**: Prevents user experience degradation. Nice-to-have for initial launch but valuable for long-term operational excellence.

**Independent Test**: Execute tool that takes > 5 seconds and verify performance warning appears in logs with time breakdown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** search query takes 6.2 seconds, **When** operation completes, **Then** performance warning logged: "search_hansard_speeches exceeded 5s threshold (6.2s total)"
2. **Given** operator queries performance logs, **When** filtering by duration > 5s, **Then** sees all slow operations with time breakdowns
3. **Given** ingest operation processes 50KB speech, **When** logging occurs, **Then** payload size and processing time per KB logged

### Edge Cases

- What happens when middleware itself throws an error while logging?
- How does system handle logging 10MB speech text without memory overflow?
- What if same error repeats 10,000 times in 1 minute (log rate limiting)?
- How are API keys and OAuth tokens redacted from error logs?
- What if multiple tools fail simultaneously during database outage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST intercept all tool execution errors and transform technical exception messages into user-friendly descriptions that explain the problem and suggest corrective actions
- **FR-002**: System MUST log every tool invocation with structured data including tool name, parameters (truncated to 5KB), execution time, outcome, and user identifier
- **FR-003**: System MUST log detailed error information including exception type, stack trace, request context, and system state for operator troubleshooting
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically redact sensitive data (API keys, OAuth tokens, email addresses) from all logs before writing to log storage
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate performance warnings when tool execution exceeds 5 seconds, including time breakdown by operation phase
- **FR-006**: System MUST suppress duplicate error logs by counting identical errors within 60-second windows and logging summaries
- **FR-007**: System MUST assign unique error IDs to each failure and return them to users for support reference
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply different error severity levels (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) based on tool type and failure impact

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ErrorLog**: Represents single error occurrence with error_id, tool_name, error_type, user_message, stack_trace, timestamp, user_id, severity, request_params (redacted), system_state
- **OperationLog**: Represents single tool execution with operation_id, tool_name, start_time, end_time, duration_ms, status, user_id, request_size, response_size, correlation_id

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Operators resolve 80% of reported errors within 10 minutes using log information alone (vs. current 60+ minutes requiring code inspection)
- **SC-002**: User error messages contain zero technical jargon or stack traces (100% transformation rate)
- **SC-003**: Operators locate relevant error logs in under 30 seconds using error IDs or correlation IDs
- **SC-004**: Performance issues detected within 2 minutes of first occurrence through automatic warnings
- **SC-005**: Middleware adds less than 50ms overhead to tool execution times (measured at 50th percentile)
