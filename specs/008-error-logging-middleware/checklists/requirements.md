# Specification Quality Checklist: Error Handling & Logging Middleware

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-23

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT users need without specifying HOW to build it (no mention of FastMCP specifics, Python, database details)
- ✅ **User-focused**: Three prioritized user stories address end-user experience (P1), operator needs (P2), and system monitoring (P3)
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Error messages, log queries, performance monitoring described in business terms
- ✅ **All sections present**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Edge Cases, Key Entities all completed

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All 8 functional requirements fully specified with clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified independently (e.g., FR-001 testable by triggering errors and verifying message content)
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: 5 quantified metrics (80% resolution rate, 100% transformation, 30s query time, 2min detection, <50ms overhead)
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic SCs**: Metrics focus on outcomes (resolution time, user satisfaction) not implementation (API latency, database performance)
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios**: 8 Given-When-Then scenarios across 3 user stories
- ✅ **Edge cases**: 5 edge cases identified (middleware errors, large payloads, high-frequency errors, sensitive data, concurrent failures)
- ✅ **Scope boundaries**: Clear in-scope (3 tools, Cloud Logging, health checks) and out-of-scope items (alerting, retention policies, custom dashboards)
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Internal (existing tools, Cloud Logging client) and external (Cloud Logging API, FastMCP framework) dependencies listed

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ **FR acceptance criteria**: Each of 8 FRs has specific, verifiable acceptance criteria
- ✅ **User scenario coverage**: Primary flows covered for all three user types (end users, operators, system monitoring)
- ✅ **Meets success criteria**: Feature design aligns with 5 measurable outcomes (faster resolution, zero jargon, quick log queries, early detection, low overhead)
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Requirements describe capabilities (error interception, structured logging, redaction) without specifying tools or code structure

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent

This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`. All requirements are clear, testable, and technology-agnostic. The prioritized user stories provide a clear implementation roadmap with independent testing milestones.

**Strengths**:
1. Well-prioritized user stories (P1: user experience, P2: operations, P3: optimization)
2. Specific, measurable success criteria with baseline comparisons
3. Comprehensive edge case identification
4. Clear scope boundaries prevent feature creep
5. Balanced between detail and flexibility for implementation

**Recommendations for planning phase**:
- Consider retry strategies for transient errors (FR-001)
- Define correlation ID generation strategy for multi-step operations (FR-002)
- Specify log aggregation query patterns for common troubleshooting scenarios (FR-003)
