# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin-Protected Markdown Ingestion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification is written from user/business perspective
- No implementation languages (Python, FastMCP) mentioned in requirements
- Focused on administrator needs and searchable content value proposition
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- All 15 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by attempting ingestion without admin token)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (5 seconds per file, 10 files/minute, 99% success rate)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of frameworks or implementation)
- 3 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- 10 edge cases identified
- Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- Each FR has corresponding acceptance scenario in user stories
- User scenarios cover bulk import (P1), single file (P2), and progress monitoring (P3)
- Success criteria include performance (SC-001, SC-002), security (SC-003), reliability (SC-004-006)
- No technology-specific details in user-facing requirements

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning phase.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization (P1-P3) enabling incremental delivery
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Security-first approach with admin-only access
- Measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Well-documented assumptions and dependencies

No updates required before proceeding to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
