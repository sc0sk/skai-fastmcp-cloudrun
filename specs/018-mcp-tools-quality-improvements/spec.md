# Feature Specification: MCP Tools Documentation and Testing Quality Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `018-mcp-tools-quality-improvements`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Based on MCP comprehensive testing results showing documentation gaps and async testing framework needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Based on MCP comprehensive testing results showing:
  - Tools work functionally but score 0.39/1.00 on best practices
  - Missing "Returns" documentation in docstrings
  - Async testing framework limitation preventing proper validation
  - Need for production-ready documentation and testing standards
-->

### User Story 1 - Developer Tool Documentation Clarity (Priority: P1)

As a developer integrating with the MCP server, I need clear and comprehensive tool documentation so that I can understand exactly what each tool returns and how to handle the responses properly.

**Why this priority**: Documentation is the first thing developers encounter and directly impacts adoption and correct usage. Our testing showed missing "Returns" sections violating MCP best practices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing tool docstrings and confirming they contain "Use this when", "Do not use", and "Returns" sections with clear response schemas.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer reads `search_hansard_speeches` documentation, **When** they check the docstring, **Then** they see clear "Returns" documentation with response schema
2. **Given** a developer reads `fetch_hansard_speech` documentation, **When** they check the docstring, **Then** they see explicit return value structure and error conditions
3. **Given** a developer integrates with tools, **When** they follow the documentation, **Then** they can handle responses correctly without guessing the format

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Async Testing Framework (Priority: P2)

As a development team, I need a robust async testing framework for MCP tools so that we can properly validate error handling, performance, and data quality without getting coroutine warnings.

**Why this priority**: Our testing revealed async functions being called synchronously, preventing proper validation of error handling and data quality (score 0.0/1.0 in these areas).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the async test framework against both tools and confirming it properly validates error handling, performance, and data quality without runtime warnings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the async test framework is implemented, **When** I run tool tests, **Then** I get no "coroutine was never awaited" warnings
2. **Given** invalid inputs are provided to tools, **When** the async test framework validates error handling, **Then** it properly captures and evaluates error responses
3. **Given** performance testing is needed, **When** the async framework measures tool execution, **Then** it provides accurate timing and response structure analysis

---

### User Story 3 - MCP Best Practices Compliance Dashboard (Priority: P3)

As a project maintainer, I want automated validation that our MCP tools meet industry best practices so that we maintain high code quality and can track improvements over time.

**Why this priority**: Enables continuous quality monitoring and provides metrics for improvement tracking. Builds on the foundation of P1 and P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the compliance dashboard and confirming it generates accurate scoring and recommendations for MCP best practices adherence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** MCP tools exist in the codebase, **When** the compliance dashboard runs, **Then** it produces a score report with specific recommendations
2. **Given** improvements are made to tools, **When** the dashboard re-runs, **Then** it shows improved scores reflecting the changes
3. **Given** new tools are added, **When** the dashboard evaluates them, **Then** it provides immediate feedback on best practices compliance

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when tools have complex return types that are difficult to document clearly?
- How does the async testing framework handle tools that may take variable amounts of time to complete?
- What if tools have different error handling patterns that don't fit standard validation approaches?
- How does the system handle tools that return large response objects that might affect performance testing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Based on MCP testing results showing specific gaps:
  - Best practices score: 0.39/1.00 (Poor - needs significant improvement)
  - Documentation: Missing "Returns" sections (violates MCP standards)
  - Error handling: 0.17/1.0 score (async testing framework issue)
  - Data quality: 0.0/1.0 score (coroutine object evaluation issue)
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Tool docstrings MUST include explicit "Returns" sections with response schema documentation
- **FR-002**: Tool docstrings MUST maintain existing "Use this when" and "Do not use" guidance sections
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide async-aware testing framework for MCP tool validation
- **FR-004**: Testing framework MUST properly evaluate error handling for async tools with invalid inputs
- **FR-005**: Testing framework MUST measure performance of async tools without coroutine warnings
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate data quality of async tool responses with proper structure analysis
- **FR-007**: Compliance validation MUST generate numerical scores for MCP best practices adherence
- **FR-008**: Documentation improvements MUST not break existing tool functionality or FastMCP compatibility
- **FR-009**: Testing framework MUST handle tools with variable execution times and response sizes
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear recommendations for improving best practices compliance scores

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **MCP Tool**: FastMCP-decorated async function with comprehensive docstring including Returns section
- **Test Result**: Structured data containing best practices scores, timing metrics, and validation status
- **Compliance Report**: Document showing current vs target scores with specific improvement recommendations
- **Documentation Schema**: Standardized format for tool docstrings including Returns, Use cases, and Anti-patterns

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  Based on current MCP testing baseline:
  - Current overall score: 0.39/1.00 (Poor)
  - Target overall score: 0.80/1.00 (Excellent)
  - Documentation currently missing Returns sections
  - Async testing framework needed for proper validation
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: MCP tools achieve overall best practices score of 0.80/1.00 or higher (up from current 0.39/1.00)
- **SC-002**: All tool docstrings include complete "Returns" sections with response schema documentation (currently 0% compliant)
- **SC-003**: Async testing framework validates error handling without coroutine warnings (currently failing)
- **SC-004**: Data quality evaluation scores 0.70/1.0 or higher for all tools (currently 0.0/1.0)
- **SC-005**: Performance testing provides accurate timing metrics for async tools (currently receiving coroutine objects)
- **SC-006**: Compliance dashboard generates actionable recommendations with 95% accuracy
- **SC-007**: Documentation improvements maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing MCP server functionality
- **SC-008**: Testing framework completes full evaluation cycle in under 30 seconds for both tools
