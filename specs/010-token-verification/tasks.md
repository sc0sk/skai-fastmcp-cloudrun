# Tasks: Token Verification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-token-verification/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature follows TDD (Test-Driven Development) as mandated by the constitution. All tests MUST be written first and verified to fail before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Project Structure**: Single project with `src/` and `tests/` at repository root
- All new code in `src/auth/` module
- All new tests in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization, dependency installation, and directory structure

- [ ] T001 Add PyJWT, cryptography, and httpx dependencies to pyproject.toml or requirements.txt
- [ ] T002 Create src/auth/ directory structure with __init__.py
- [ ] T003 Create tests/unit/ test files structure for auth module
- [ ] T004 Create tests/fixtures/auth/ directory for test data (keys, tokens, JWKS responses)
- [ ] T005 [P] Install pytest-httpx for HTTP mocking in introspection tests
- [ ] T006 [P] Install pytest-asyncio for async test support

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data models and base classes that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

### Data Models (Foundation for all verifiers)

- [ ] T010 [P] Create TokenVerifier abstract base class in src/auth/base.py with verify() and verify_scopes() methods
- [ ] T011 [P] Implement extract_bearer_token() method in TokenVerifier base class

### Unit Tests for Foundation (TDD - Write First, Verify They Fail)

- [ ] T012 [P] Write unit test for TokenClaims model in tests/unit/test_auth_models.py (identity property, scope checking methods)
- [ ] T013 [P] Write unit test for ValidationResult model in tests/unit/test_auth_models.py (success/failure factory methods)
- [ ] T014 [P] Write unit test for extract_bearer_token() in tests/unit/test_token_verifier_base.py (valid/invalid header formats)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - verify all foundation tests FAIL (red phase). User story implementation can now begin in parallel.

- [ ] T031 [US1] Implement JWKS endpoint failure handling in src/auth/jwt.py (graceful degradation with cached keys, fail closed on validation errors)
- [ ] T032 [US1] Add logging for JWT validation events in src/auth/jwt.py (validation success, failures, JWKS fetches, cache hits/misses)
- [ ] T033 [US1] Implement scope validation in src/auth/jwt.py (verify_scopes() method checking required scopes against token scopes)

**Checkpoint**: Run all User Story 1 tests - they should now PASS (green phase). JWT validation with JWKS endpoints is fully functional and independently testable.

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Error handling, logging, documentation, and integration verification

**‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-Story**: These tasks span multiple user stories and should be done after core functionality is complete

### Error Handling & Logging

- [ ] T083 [P] Implement comprehensive error messages in src/auth/base.py (user-friendly messages for common errors, mask internal details)
- [ ] T084 [P] Add structured logging for all verifiers in src/auth/__init__.py (validation success/failure, performance metrics, security events)
- [ ] T085 [P] Implement error masking in production in src/auth/base.py (prevent sensitive information leakage in error messages)

### Edge Case Handling

- [ ] T086 [P] Handle malformed JWT tokens in src/auth/jwt.py (cannot parse, invalid base64, missing segments)
- [ ] T087 [P] Handle missing identity claims in src/auth/jwt.py (no subject or client_id in token)
- [ ] T088 [P] Handle missing scope claims when scopes required in src/auth/jwt.py (token has no scope claim but scopes are required)
- [ ] T089 [P] Handle non-conforming introspection responses in src/auth/introspection.py (missing active field, unexpected format)
- [ ] T090 [P] Handle concurrent JWKS key rotation in src/auth/jwt.py (support multiple simultaneous keys via kid matching)
- [ ] T091 [P] Handle future-issued tokens within clock skew in src/auth/jwt.py (iat in future but within leeway)
- [ ] T092 [P] Handle multiple Authorization headers in src/auth/base.py (reject requests with multiple auth headers)

### Test Fixtures & Test Helpers

- [ ] T093 [P] Create test fixtures in tests/fixtures/auth/test_tokens.py (sample valid/invalid tokens for all algorithms)
- [ ] T094 [P] Create test JWKS responses in tests/fixtures/auth/mock_jwks.json (sample JWKS with multiple keys, kid matching)
- [ ] T095 [P] Create test introspection responses in tests/fixtures/auth/mock_introspection.json (active/inactive responses, various metadata)
- [ ] T096 [P] Create pytest fixtures for common test setup in tests/conftest.py (mock JWKS server, mock introspection endpoint, test key pairs)

### Integration Testing

- [ ] T097 Create end-to-end integration test in tests/integration/test_full_auth_flow.py (combine multiple auth methods, verify all user stories work together)
- [ ] T098 Create performance test in tests/integration/test_performance.py (verify <100ms JWT validation, <200ms introspection p95)
- [ ] T099 Create security test in tests/integration/test_security.py (verify fail-closed behavior, proper error masking, no information leakage)

### Documentation

- [ ] T100 [P] Add docstrings to all public methods in src/auth/ module (comprehensive API documentation)
- [ ] T101 [P] Add type hints to all functions in src/auth/ module (full type coverage for IDE support)
- [ ] T102 [P] Update src/auth/__init__.py to export public API (JWTVerifier, IntrospectionTokenVerifier, StaticTokenVerifier, RSAKeyPair, config models)

### Refactoring (Optional - Only if TDD reveals duplicates)

- [ ] T103 Extract common validation logic if duplicated across verifiers in src/auth/base.py
- [ ] T104 Refactor error handling if patterns emerge across verifiers in src/auth/base.py

## Dependencies & Parallel Execution

### User Story Dependency Graph

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational Models & Base Classes) ‚Üê MUST complete before any user story

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 3: US1 (JWT w/ JWKS) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Can run in parallel ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 4: US2 (HMAC)         ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Can run in parallel ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 5: US3 (Introspection) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Can run in parallel ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 8 (Polish)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 6: US4 (Dev Utilities) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Can run in parallel ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§

```

### Parallel Execution Examples

**After Phase 2 completes, these can run simultaneously:**

**Team A**: US1 (JWT with JWKS)
```bash
# Tasks T015-T033 can be assigned to Team A
# Tests first (T015-T021), then implementation (T022-T033)
```

**Team B**: US2 (HMAC Validation)
```bash
# Tasks T034-T040 can be assigned to Team B
# Tests first (T034-T036), then implementation (T037-T040)
```

**Team C**: US3 (Introspection)
```bash
# Tasks T041-T055 can be assigned to Team C
# Tests first (T041-T045), then implementation (T046-T055)
```

**Team D**: US4 (Dev Utilities)
```bash
# Tasks T056-T072 can be assigned to Team D
# Tests first (T056-T061), then implementation (T062-T072)
```

**Team E**: US5 (Environment Config)
```bash
# Tasks T073-T082 can be assigned to Team E
# Tests first (T073-T076), then implementation (T077-T082)
```

### Critical Path

**Sequential (Cannot parallelize):**
1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Phase 2: Foundation (T007-T014)
3. Phase 8: Polish & Integration (T083-T104) - requires all user stories complete

**Total Duration Estimate** (with 5 parallel teams):
- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 2 days
- Phase 3-7 (parallel): 5 days (longest user story path)
- Phase 8: 2 days
- **Total: ~10 days with parallel execution** vs ~25 days sequential

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)

**Recommended MVP**: User Story 1 ONLY (Production JWT with JWKS)

**Rationale**:
- Delivers core security value for production deployments
- Covers most common enterprise use case (OAuth providers)
- Enables immediate integration with Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Google
- Fully testable independently
- Can be shipped and deliver value before other stories

**MVP Tasks**: T001-T033 (Setup + Foundation + US1)
- **Duration**: ~4 days with one team
- **Deliverable**: Functional JWT validation with JWKS endpoints

### Incremental Delivery Plan

**Release 1 (MVP)**: US1 - Production JWT validation
- Tasks: T001-T033
- Value: Enterprise OAuth integration

**Release 2**: US1 + US2 - Add HMAC for microservices
- Tasks: T034-T040
- Value: Internal service authentication

**Release 3**: US1 + US2 + US5 - Add environment config
- Tasks: T073-T082
- Value: Multi-environment deployments

**Release 4**: US1 + US2 + US5 + US3 - Add introspection
- Tasks: T041-T055
- Value: Opaque token support

**Release 5 (Complete)**: All user stories + polish
- Tasks: T001-T104
- Value: Full feature set with development utilities

---

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 104
- Setup: 6 tasks
- Foundational: 8 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1): 19 tasks (7 tests + 12 implementation)
- User Story 2 (P1): 7 tasks (3 tests + 4 implementation)
- User Story 3 (P2): 15 tasks (5 tests + 10 implementation)
- User Story 4 (P3): 17 tasks (6 tests + 11 implementation)
- User Story 5 (P2): 10 tasks (4 tests + 6 implementation)
- Polish & Cross-Cutting: 22 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 5 user stories can be implemented in parallel after foundation (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Within each story: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Estimated 60% time savings with parallel execution (10 days vs 25 days)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Configure JWKS endpoint, verify token validation and rejection scenarios
- **US2**: Configure HMAC secret, verify symmetric key validation
- **US3**: Configure introspection endpoint, verify opaque token validation
- **US4**: Use static tokens and key generation, verify development workflows
- **US5**: Set environment variables, verify configuration loading

**MVP Recommendation**: US1 only (T001-T033) - 33 tasks delivering core production value

**TDD Approach**: All test tasks MUST be written first and verified to FAIL before implementation begins (constitution requirement)

**Format Validation**: ‚úÖ All 104 tasks follow checklist format with ID, [P] marker (where applicable), [Story] label (for user story tasks), and file paths
