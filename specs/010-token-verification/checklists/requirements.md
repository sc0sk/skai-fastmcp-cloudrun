## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on token validation behaviors, security properties, and user outcomes without mentioning specific Python libraries, FastMCP implementation details, or code structure.

✅ **User value focus**: Each user story clearly articulates the persona (system integrator, platform engineer, security engineer, developer, DevOps engineer) and the value they receive (security integration, microservice authentication, OAuth compliance, development productivity, deployment flexibility).

✅ **Non-technical language**: While the domain (token verification, OAuth, JWT) is inherently technical, the specification avoids implementation jargon and focuses on "what" and "why" rather than "how".

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated with detailed content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The specification contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are fully specified with industry-standard defaults (60-second clock skew tolerance, standard HMAC algorithms, RFC 7662 compliance).

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-020) describes specific, verifiable behavior that can be tested through automated tests or manual validation scenarios.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: 100% validation accuracy within 100ms
- SC-002: 100% rejection rate with error messages
- SC-003: <50ms latency overhead
- SC-004: 200ms at 95th percentile
- SC-005: Zero request drops during key rotation
- SC-006: <5 minutes setup time
- SC-007: Zero code changes for environment switching
- SC-008: Graceful degradation with cached keys
- SC-009: Informative errors without security leaks
- SC-010: 10,000 concurrent requests without degradation

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No success criteria mention implementation technologies. They focus on user-observable outcomes (response times, accuracy, setup time, deployment flexibility).

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of the 5 user stories includes 2-5 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format, covering both success and failure cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 10 edge cases are documented covering failure modes (endpoint unavailability, malformed tokens, missing claims, clock skew, concurrent key rotation, etc.).

✅ **Scope bounded**: The specification clearly limits scope to token *validation* (resource server role) and explicitly excludes token *issuance* and user authentication flows (FR-015).

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Implicit assumptions are reasonable and industry-standard:
- JWT and OAuth 2.0 standards compliance
- Bearer token format in Authorization headers
- 60-second clock skew tolerance
- JWKS key caching and periodic refresh
- Standard HMAC key length requirements

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is matched to acceptance scenarios in the user stories, providing clear verification criteria.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 5 user stories cover the complete scope with clear priorities:
- P1: Production JWT validation (JWKS)
- P1: Internal microservice validation (HMAC)
- P2: Opaque token validation (introspection)
- P2: Environment-based configuration
- P3: Development/testing utilities

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: Success criteria provide comprehensive metrics for validation accuracy, performance, developer experience, and operational flexibility.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The specification maintains abstraction by describing token verification behaviors and security properties without prescribing implementation approaches.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`. All quality checklist items pass validation:

- Content is user-focused and technology-agnostic
- Requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria provide measurable outcomes
- User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- Edge cases are comprehensively documented
- Scope is well-bounded (validation only, not issuance)

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation planning artifacts
2. No clarifications needed - all requirements are well-specified with industry-standard defaults
