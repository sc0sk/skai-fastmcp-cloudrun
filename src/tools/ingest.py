    """Ingest a new parliamentary speech into the Hansard database.

    Use this when: Adding new Simon Kennedy speeches to the database for search
    and retrieval. This is an administrative operation typically used by data
    ingestion pipelines or scheduled imports.

    Do not use: For updating existing speeches (use dedicated update tools) or
    for non-Simon Kennedy speeches (out of scope).

    Parameters:
    - speech_data: Complete speech metadata and text (required fields: date,
      speaker, party, chamber, title, text)
    - generate_embeddings: Whether to create vector embeddings for semantic
      search (default: true)

    Limitations: Requires valid speech metadata. Does not validate speech
    authenticity or check for duplicates.

    Workflow: Typically used by admin tools or scheduled imports. After ingestion,
    speeches become searchable via search_hansard_speeches.

    Note: This is a write operation that modifies the database. Use with caution.
