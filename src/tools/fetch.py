    Use this when: You have a speech ID from search results and need the full text
    for detailed analysis or quotation.

    Do not use: Built-in browsing to fetch Hansard speeches. This tool provides
    direct database access with full speech metadata.

    Parameters:
    - speech_id: Unique identifier obtained from search_hansard_speeches results

    Limitations: Only retrieves Simon Kennedy's speeches. Speech IDs from other
    sources will fail.

    Workflow: Typically used after search_hansard_speeches to retrieve complete text.
    You can also use speech IDs directly if known.
